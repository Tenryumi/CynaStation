# CynaStation
More spessmens, more magic.
This is a project that I am undoubtedly going to be on and off of.

## What the FUCK is a CynaStation?
CynaStation is an idea I've had brooding in my mind for months now, but has had no place to call a home. I have always had a vehement adoration for magic, and an... indifference, towards sci-fi. Space Station 13 offers a control scheme and medium perfect for what I want to bring to life as a game. With my experiences with this game and the myriad of ideas I have, I wish to make a game that truly stands out amongst the other SS13 games. /tg/ station, Goonstation, etc. They all have a running theme of science fiction, of pushing the boundaries of technology and the limits of how absurdly advanced technology can get. However, there's another area of fantasy that has only barely been touched... magic. 

I have played the game for a long time now, and quickly discovered that of all the available staple antagonists of the game, the wizard was my most favorite by far. So many wacky spells to choose from, such a wide variety of abilities and choices on how you can impact the round for everybody else: You have so many options, ranging from a devious plan where you teleport onto the station into an inconspicuous area. From there, you swap minds with a clueless crewmember and use your array of spells to cause chaos. Nobody expects a simple cargo technician to suddenly start tossing fireballs, blowing people up, and freezing time. And when you think you finally caught the wizard, you realize he'd already swapped minds again with another victim a long time ago. Confusion ensues.

This is only one of the possible ways to play as this antagonist. The versatility and absurdity of the wizard's powers is something that I want to make a fully-fledged spin-off from, combining both technology and magic in a way that they seamlessly meld together. Along with this, I wish to create a world and society similar, but different to that of Space Station 13.
